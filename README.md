# calendar.txt format
A complete primer on the whys and hows of calendar.txt
The first and most important rule of calendar.txt:

> A single line in your calendar.txt text file represents a single (repeating) event.

### Why plain text?
Plain text is software and operating system agnostic. It's searchable, portable, lightweight, and easily manipulated. It's unstructured. It works when someone else's web server is down or your Outlook .PST file is corrupt. There's no exporting and importing, no databases or tags or flags or stars or prioritizing or _insert company name here_-induced rules on what you can and can't do with it.

This project is inspired by [todo.txt](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt).

There currently is no final design on how calendar.txt format should be. You can submit your format design in [this issue](https://github.com/murtezayesil/calendar.txt/issues/1).
